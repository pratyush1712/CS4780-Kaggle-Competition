# CS4780-Kaggle-Competition

Submission for the optional project for class CS 4780 (Intro to Machine Learning) at Cornell.

## Overivew
### Pre-processing:
- Scaled the data to prevent any one feature from dominating the predcitions.
- Filled missing features in the testing data with mean of that feature across all the testing points.
### Model Used:
- Trained the data on 4 different models: Linear Kernel SVM, Poly Kernel SVM, Gaussian SVM, and <strong>Sigmoid SVM</strong>.
- Ended up getting most accurate results with <strong>Sigmoid SVM</strong>
